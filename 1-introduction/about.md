Phundament is a template for web applications built upon Docker, PHP and Yii Framework 2.0.

Design goals
-----------------

The goal of Phundament is to provide a consistent and rock-solid base for integrating the best tools, libraries and plugins, while not creating a new framework or [another competing standard](http://xkcd.com/927/). 

Its goal is to provide a complete build, test and deployment environment for dockerized applications, defined in `docker-compose` YAML files - which we call stacks.

Whenever possible, existing tools are pre-configured in a clean and easy way and built on Docker images to ensure 100% compatibility across different platforms.

It follows the [12factor specifications](http://12factor.net) on a very slim codebase.



Branches
--------

The Phundament repository contains the following main branches:

- master (development, unstable)
- 4.0 (alpha, beta, RC, stable releases)
- 3.0 (alpha, beta, RC, stable releases)
