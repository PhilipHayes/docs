Phundament is a Web Application Foundation built upon Docker, PHP and Yii Framework 2.0 and further tools, providing a consistent environment for rapidly developing web
applications - from development to deployment.


It is a dockerized toolset for rapid prototyping, developing, testing, building and deploying high-quality web applications.


It features continuous integration support, built upon open-source software, using as much native tools as possible.

Its goal is to provide a complete build, test and deployment environment for dockerized applications, defined in `docker-compose` YAML files - which we call stacks.




### Design goals

The goal of Phundament is to provide a rock-solid base for integrating the best tools and plugins for web-application development, 
while not creating a new framework or [another competing standard](http://xkcd.com/927/). 

Instead, existing tools are pre-configured in a clean and easy way and built on Docker images to ensure 100% compatibility across different platforms.

Compared to the standard Yii 2.0 application templates, Phundament introduces a configuration based on *environment variables*,
which gives you a maximum level of control over your application setup. It follows the [12factor specifications](http://12factor.net) on a very slim codebase.
